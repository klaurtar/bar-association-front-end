            BAMSL needed production services, marketing, and they wanted it to
            be as professional and relevant as any instructor-led course
            delivered in person. They gave Geniecast access to their social
            media accounts and attorney database to handle all event promotion
            as well as tracking for signups, payments, and attendees to ensure
            everyone received proper credit for taking the necessary courses.
            <br />
            <br />
            The event was treated like a ticketed event, charging attendees at
            sign-up rather than requiring a budget-busting up-front fee from
            BAMSL. Email reminders, press releases, and printed flyers along
            with an online registration page for sign-ups were developed for
            this event. Customized reporting was created to track audience
            log-ins as well as average watch-time .

              BAMSL was using a patchwork system to deliver their CLE content
              virtually; attendees had to rely on their cell phones and various
              non-dedicated applications to receive their instruction. Problems
              with video streams, audio quality, and overall user
              dissatisfaction were common. BAMSL Executive Director, Zoe Linza,
              reached out to other Bar Associations around the country and
              discovered they all were dealing with similar issues with no
              viable solution.

            “We were thrilled with the response to our first Cast with
            Geniecast, the quality was superb, the attention to detail by the
            staff and readiness to assist any participant outstanding. I am so
            pleased with our partnership and look forward to more great
            productions.” <br /><br />
